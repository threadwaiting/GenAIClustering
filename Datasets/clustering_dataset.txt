Heartbreak? Heartbreak? She's my girlfriend for two months, I chose her over my girlfriend for 2 years. I like her so much to the point that I can't let her go even if she wants to end our relationship because of the other people around us most especially her family. I do the things for her that I'm not used to for a girl and I am willing to sacrifice everything just to have a little time with her. A little and limited time that I'm asking from her but she don't wanna give it to me. She's scared that someone might see us, that she's still having an affair with me. I love her and I want to be with her at least once a week even if just for a limited time. I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing, all of my friends told me to stop it and just let it go 2 months is just 2 months not a deep relationship. But they don't feel what I feel, in this span of time I learned a lot, I learned how to love, to be loved, to sacrifice a good life, and to sacrifice a better clear future. My mind tells me to stop, but my heart tells me to hold, don't give up, stay with her and give her the unconditional love. Should I follow my mind or follow my heart?

I have been married almost 15 years. We have two children, 11 and 8. My childhood was horrible, seven years of sexual, physical, and mental/emotional abuse followed by instability and low self esteem issues as a teen. My husband met me after I began dealing with my childhood and knew all about my issues. He knew what would end our marriage, yet he did it and lied about it multiple times. I was pregnant and did not leave. We tried to make it work. We had another child. We have been through MANY "situations" in our marriage and as parents. For the past 6-8 years we have just been living as parents. Not lovers. In the past I tried everything to make our marriage work. I finally decided to be done with it. Now he says he loves me and wants to make it work. But he is manipulative and can be so mean. He uses my children to cause me pain and stress. He knows that they are the only reason I stay. We are in counciling, but I really have no "love" feelings for him. I told him I want a divorce, but he won't give me one. He has said he will make my life miserable until the 18 months of separation are up and divorce is granted. Any advice? I'm ready to run away...
